# RUN CHATGPT INTERMUX

**I've created two scripts, one in Python and one in Shell, that you can use to run ChatGPT in Termux. Here are the steps and code snippets to install and use them:**

**1. Install Git:**

```bash
apt install git
```

**2. Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/UzairDeveloper223/CHATGPT-WITHOUT-API-FOR-TERMUX.git
```

**3. Make the scripts executable:**

```bash
chmod +x *
```

**4. Choose your preferred script:**

**Option A: Run the Shell script:**

```bash
./CHATGPT.sh
```

**Option B: Run the Python script:**

```bash
apt install python3 && python CHATGPT.py
```

**By following these steps and executing the appropriate script, you should be able to interact with ChatGPT within Termux.**
